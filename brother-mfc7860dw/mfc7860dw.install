  NOTE 1: Remember to add user to lp group using:
      gpasswd -a USER lp
  NOTE 2: Remember to logout after adding groups
  NOTE 3: Remember to execute as root the following executable:	
      /usr/local/Brother/Printer/MFC7860DW/cupswrapper/cupswrapperMFC7860DW-2.0.4
  NOTE 4: x86_64 users should also install 'lib32-libcups' package
  NOTE 5: if the printer still won't work, try installing some of the more
    generic Brother-related drivers from AUR in parallel with this one;
    I haven't found out yet the precise list of dependencies but they are 
    surely installed along with these packages.
